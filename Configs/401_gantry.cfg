speed: 200                           #   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration. The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 3                 #   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
retries: 5                           #   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.005              #   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed points differ more than retry_tolerance.
max_adjust: 15                       #   Safety limit if an adjustment greater than this value is requested quad_gantry_level will abort.
